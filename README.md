# scripts4youunix

scripts4younix is my set of scripts 4 unix that can be scripts 4 u!

WARNING: These scripts need to undergo more testing, so for now, feel free to look at them, but use them with caution. Don't worry, I will soon finish the testing and then you should be able to freely run these scripts yourself. This is currently a work-in-progress.

As mentioned in the name, this is for scripting UNIX-like operating system installs. If you are not using a UNIX-like operating system (such as Microsoft Windows), then I would suggest to not run these on your machine. However, feel free to learn from them! I am planning on eventually scripting on a Windows install and improving my PowerShell skills.
